  👋 Hi, I’m Anca. Born and raised in Romania. Flight attendant since 2015. Visited over 50+ countries. Lived in UAE for 5 years. Currently based in Germany. Can speak 4 languages, trying to learn the 5th one. A well developed ... sense of humor.
 
   👀 Have a special skill of getting lost into social media. That is why I tend to delete my Instagram app probably every other week. :|
  
   🌱 I started my coding journey couple of months ago, because my husband made me. :)) I am kidding! It was a mutual decision. But seriously, I love it. Currently still on JavaScript.
    Someone please let me know if there is any magic potion to drink and wake up tomorrow a JS wizard...or at least a small magic mouse that CAN do JS. 
    
   💞️ I’m looking forward to learn how to post my code here, and receive guidance and feedback. I might cry sometimes, but dont worry, I will turn-off my camera and mute my microphone.
